    "# 1. Introduction\n",
    "The purpose of this notebook is to introduce and go over the basics of the Python programming language. We'll be looking at Python from the viewpoint of someone who has familiarity with programming already in a lower-level language like C or C++. This notebook was adapted from [Justin Johnson's Intro to Python tutorial](http://cs231n.github.io/python-numpy-tutorial/#python-containers) and [The Python Tutorial](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/index.html).\n",

    "## 1.1 What is Python?\n",
    "Python is a **high-level**, **dynamically typed** and **interpreted** language. For those without a CS background, the previous statement may seem a little too jargony, so lets unpack it. \n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.1.1 High-Level\n",
    "When we say a language is high-level, it generally means that it is a language with a lot more built in abstractions to hide some of the nastier parts of programming. A common practice is for people to prototype algorithms with high-level languages and then write faster implementations of those algorithms in a lower level language like C++. Throughout this notebook, we'll be making comparisons to C in order to give a better understanding of the advantages that a high-level language offers over a lower-level one. \n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.1.2 Interpreted Language\n",
    "Here lies the first difference between C and Python. In C, in order to run our code on our machines, we must first compile it. As a review, compiling a program means taking the language syntax and turning it into machine code that can actually run on your computer's processor. The problem with this approach is that you need to write your program and then compile it and then run it. This can be cumbersome when trying to do rapid prototyping of an algorithm. Python aims to fix this by interpreting lines of code. Interpreting simply means we can run a line of code as soon as we type it out. This happens to be how our IPython Notebooks work. For each cell of code that we run, the Python interpreter is called to run and execute each line. The advantage of this is that we can instantly see the results of each line of code as we are developing it. This makes it much easier to prototype a program and ensure its working. The below cell gives an example of how this works. You can run a cell by pressing the play button (Run button) or using the keyboard shortcut Shift + Enter.\n",

    "A common issue when debugging Python code is that the interpreter has inferred the wrong type for a variable you are working with, causing unforeseen results in your program. If you are struggling to find a logical issue with a large Python program, you should immediately look to use the type() function to verify that the types of your variables are what you expect. As a good practice, you should use an assert for proper type checking in the places of your code you feel its needed. "
