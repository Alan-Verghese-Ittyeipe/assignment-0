a. Remote and Local:
From what I understand, in GitHub, local refers to the repository on my computer, while remote refers to the repository stored online on GitHub. These two versions help people work together on the same project even if they are in different places.

b. Forking:
I understand forking as making a copy of someone else’s GitHub repository into my own GitHub account. This lets me work on the project separately without changing the original version.

c. Cloning:
Cloning, as I understand it, means downloading a GitHub repository to my computer. This allows me to work on the project offline and make changes from my own system.

d. Push and Pull:
I think of "push" as sending the changes I made on my local computer to the GitHub repository online. "Pull" is the opposite—getting any new updates from the remote repository to my local one, so both are up to date.

e. Commit:
In my understanding, a commit is when I save changes I’ve made to a file or project, along with a short message explaining what I did. It helps keep track of all the changes made over time.
